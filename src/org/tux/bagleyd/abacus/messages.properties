AbacusApplet.DanishDescription=The Danish Abacus was used in the early 20th century in elementary schools as a teaching aid.
AbacusApplet.DecksDescription=The device has two decks. Each deck, separated by a partition, normally has 13 rails on which are mounted beads. Each rail on the top deck contains 1 or 2 beads, and each rod on the bottom deck contains 4 or 5 beads.  Each bead on the upper deck has a value of five, while each bead on the lower deck has value of one. Beads are considered counted, when moved towards the partition separating the decks, i.e. to add a value of one, a bead in the bottom deck is moved up, and to add a value of 5, a bead in the top deck is moved down.

AbacusApplet.DemoInstructions=Demo Mode: in this mode, the abacus is controlled by the program.  When started with the demo option, a second window is presented that should be placed directly below the abacus-window. Descriptive text, and user prompts are displayed in this window.  Pressing 'q' during the demo will quit it.  Clicking the left mouse-button with the pointer in the window will restart the demo (beginning of current lesson).

AbacusApplet.JapaneseDescription=The pre-WWII Japanese Abacus (Soroban) (or Korean Supan) is similar to the Chinese Abacus but has only one bead per rail on the top deck.  The later Japanese Abacus was further simplified to have only 4 beads per rail on the bottom deck.

AbacusApplet.LInstructions=Press "L" or "l" keys to toggle the availability of anomaly bars.  Intended to used with Japanese Abacus and base 20 for the Mesoamerican Abacus. (Mutually exclusive to watch bars).
AbacusApplet.MedievalDescription=The Medieval Counter is a primitive form of the abacus and was used in Europe as late as the 1600s.  It was useful considering they were using it with Roman Numerals.   This is similar to the Salamis Greek Tablet from 4th or 5thCentury BCE.
AbacusApplet.MesoamericanDescription=The Mesoamerican Nepohualtzintzin is a Japanese Abacus base 20.  The Mesoamericans had base 20 with the exception of the 3rd decimal place where instead of 20 * 20 = 400 the third place marked 360 and the 4th place was20 * 360, etc.  They independently created their own zero (only Babylon (base 60) and India (base 10) have done this)but the anomaly took away its true power. An easy way of figuring out time in seconds given hours, minutes, and seconds, can be done on the abacus with special Japanese Abacus with special anomaly "watch" settings. The Chinese Solid-and-Broken-Bar System is a base 12 numbering system and not really an abacus.  When the abacus is setup in this way though (topFactor 3, topNumber 3, bottomNumber 2, base 12, displayBase 12), it is easy to relate the two. The signed bead is an invention of the author and is not present on any historical abacus (to his knowledge) and isused to represent negatives.  "New & Improved" abacus models have two auxiliary decks stacked above the principal deck that enable multiplication, division, square-root, and cube-root computations to be performed with equal ease as addition and subtraction (well, so I have read).

AbacusApplet.OperationsDescription=The basic operations of the abacus are addition and subtraction. Multiplication can be done by mentally multiplying the digits and adding up the intermediate results on the abacus. Division would be similar where the intermediate results are subtracted.  There are techniques like using your thumb with forefinger which does not apply with mouse entry. Also with multiplication, one can carry out calculations on different parts of the abacus for scratch work, here it is nice to have a long abacus.

AbacusApplet.RomanDescription=The Roman Hand-Abacus predates the Chinese Abacus and is very similar to the later Japanese Abacus, but seems to have fallen out of use with the Fall of the Roman Empire (at least 3 are in existence).  The Roman Abaci are brass plates where the beads move in slots.  In addition to the normal 7 columns of beads, they generally have 2 special columns on the right side.  In two examples: the first special column was for 12ths (12 uncia (ounces) = 1 as) and had one extra bead in the bottom deck.  Also the last column was a combination of halves, quarters, and twelfths of an ounce and had no beads in the top deck and 4 beads at the bottom (beads did not have to come to the top to be counted but at one of 3 marked points, where the top bead was for halves, the next bead for quarters, and the last two beads for twelfths).  In another surviving example: the 2 special columns were switched and the combination column was broken into 3 separate slots.  If available, decimal input is ignored.

AbacusApplet.RussianDescription=The Russian Abacus was invented in the 17th century, here the beads are moved from right to left.  It has colored beads in the middle for ease of use.  Quarters represent 1/4 Rubles and are only present historically on the Russian Abacus (Schoty).  Some of the older Schoty have a extra place for the 1/4 Kopek (quarter percent) as well as the 1/4 Ruble (quarter).
